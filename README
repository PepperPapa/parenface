parenface-plus
==============

Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org> released the excellent parenface package which fontifies parentheses in Lispy modes in Emacs here: http://www.davep.org/emacs/parenface.el

My addition was to add support for editor and REPL modes of:
* Clojure 
* nREPL
* IELM
* Jess
* inferior-jess
